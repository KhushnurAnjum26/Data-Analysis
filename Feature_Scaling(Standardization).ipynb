        "\n",
        "Feature Scaling is a technique to normalize or standardize the range of independent variables (features) of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most machine learning algorithms, features with different scales can cause problems because many models rely on distance or assume data is centered.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Suppose you have the following data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Height (cm)\tWeight (kg)\n",
        "170\t70\n",
        "180\t90\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Without scaling, \"Weight\" has a smaller numerical range than \"Height\", but that doesn’t mean it’s less important. Algorithms like KNN, SVM, and Gradient Descent-based methods can get biased due to this.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **1. Why do we need Feature Scaling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithms like KNN, K-Means, SVM, PCA, Logistic Regression use distance or magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Features with larger ranges dominate those with smaller ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Descent may take longer to converge or get stuck.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "In KNN, if height ranges from 150–200 and weight from 1–10, the model will care more about height than weight—unless you scale them.\n",

        "Standardization assumes the data follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution, meaning most values are around the mean and gradually decrease toward the extremes.\n",
